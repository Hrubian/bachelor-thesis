\section{Results}

Our work has two major results.
The first result is the proposition of the framework for analyzing data-manipulation programs using abstract
interpretation.
The idea could be used with other languages like the Tibble~\cite{tibble} library in R\@.
The second result is the implementation of Pandalyzer---the Pandas analyzer based on the proposed framework.
The Pandalyzer is still in the early stage of the development process, and it serves as a proof of concept rather
than production-ready software.
However, it already supports a large range of Pandas functions, and it proves that the idea is implementable and can be
very useful in practice.

\subsection{Future Work}

The future works include adding support for other Pandas functions, other Python language constructs or including
Pandas Indexes in the analysis process.
The Pandalyzer could also be extended to support other well-known and related Python libraries such as Numpy,
Matplotlib or Scipy.

Another field where the Pandalyzer will be extended in the future is its integration to the IDEs such as PyCharm or
VS Code.
This could be done using the Language Server Protocol.
