\section{Background}

Abstract Interpretation is a program analysis method that interprets the computer program over an abstract domain
(usually defined as a lattice), gaining partial information about the semantics of the program.
The underlying theory of Abstract Interpretation is based on a pair of Lattices (\emph{Abstract Lattice} and
\emph{Concrete Lattice}~\cite{Blanchet:2002:AI})
connected by a Galois Connection.
An example of an abstraction can be representing integers by their signs --- \{+, -, \emph{any}\},
where \emph{any} represents a number that can be either positive or negative.
