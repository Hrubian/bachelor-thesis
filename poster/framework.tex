The Pandas library provides the user with two main data structures: one-dimensional Series
and two-dimensional tabular DataFrame.
To be able to interpret the program with Pandas over the abstract domain, we must define the abstract lattice.
The picture TODO shows how the abstract lattice is defined.
There is the UnresolvedStructure at the bottom of the hierarchy, representing a value that we were not
able to derive (usually due to some error in execution).
