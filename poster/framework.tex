The Pandas library provides the user with two main data structures: one-dimensional Series
and two-dimensional tabular DataFrame.
To be able to interpret the program with Pandas over the abstract domain, we must define the abstract lattice.
The Figures~\ref{fig:hierarchy}~and~\ref{fig:upper_part} show how the abstract lattice is defined.

\begin{tikzfigure}[Lower part of the Lattice]
    \label{fig:hierarchy}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{poster/img/hier}
\end{tikzfigure}

\begin{tikzfigure}[Upper part of the Lattice]
    \label{fig:upper_part}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{poster/img/nondeterm}
\end{tikzfigure}

There is the UnresolvedStructure at the bottom of the hierarchy, representing a value that we were not
able to derive (usually due to some error in execution).
And there is a NondeterministicStructure as a supremum for each pair representing uncertainty between two options.
The uncertainty usually occurs in the if-statement, where we are not able to decide which branch to take.
