The Pandalyzer is capable of detecting errors such as access to non-existent column, operation on incompatible types,
incorrect function arguments, operations leading to an incorrect state.
It also reports the structure of the output CSV files and is able to accept information about the structure of the input CSV files.
The Pandalyzer is able to work with some amount of uncertainty generated from the user input.
The supported functions include merge, groupby, drop, rename, read\_csv, to\_csv, concat, Dataframe creation,
Series creation, the subscript operator in both get and set contexts and vectorized sums and products, aggregation function
such as mean, sum, first, last, count or head.

Moreover, the Pandalyzer is highly extensible, so implementing support for other Pandas functions is possible.
