%The Pandalyzer is capable of detecting errors such as access to non-existent column, operation on incompatible types,
%incorrect function arguments, operations leading to an incorrect state.
%It also reports the structure of the output CSV files and is able to accept information about the structure of the input CSV files.
%The Pandalyzer is able to work with some amount of uncertainty generated from the user input.
%The supported functions include merge, groupby, drop, rename, read\_csv, to\_csv, concat, Dataframe creation,
%Series creation, the subscript operator in both get and set contexts and vectorized sums and products, aggregation function
%such as mean, sum, first, last, count or head.
%
%Moreover, the Pandalyzer is highly extensible, so implementing support for other Pandas functions is possible.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Detecting access to non-existent column, operation on incompatible types, incorrect function arguments or
    operations leading to incorrect state
    \item CSV output reporting
    \item CSV input hint handling
    \item Handling uncertainty from the user input
    \item Supports pandas functions including merge, groupby, drop, rename, read\_csv, to\_csv, concat, Dataframe
    and Series creation, subscript in get and set contexts, vectorized sum and product, aggregation functions (mean, sum,
    first, last, count, head)
    \item High extensibility (w.r.t.\ other pandas function)
