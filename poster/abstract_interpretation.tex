Abstract Interpretation is a program analysis method based on the idea
of abstracting the semantics of a program and interpretation of the
program over the abstracted semantics.
It uses the theory of Lattices and Galois Connection and is a sound method.
We define an Abstract Interpretation framework for the Pandas library and Python language and use it for the analysis.
