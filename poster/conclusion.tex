Our work has two major results.
The first result is the proposition of the framework for abstract interpretation of data-manipulation programs.
The idea of the framework could be used with other data-manipulation libraries in other languages like
Tibble in R (R also has built-in support for data frames) or DataFrames.jl in Julia.
The second result is the implementation of the Pandalyzer - Pandas analyzer based
on the Abstract Interpretation framework proposed.
The Pandalyzer is still in the early stage of the development process and a lot of work is planned.
It serves as a proof of concept of the Abstract Interpretation framework for data-manipulation programs.
However, it shows that the idea is implementable and can be very useful in practice.
The future works include adding support for other Pandas functions, Python language constructs, or Pandas Indexes.
The Pandalyzer could also be extended to support other well-known related Python libraries such as Numpy or Matplotlib
and integrate the Pandalyzer to the IDEs using the Language Server Protocol.
