Our work has two major results.
The first result is the proposition of the framework for abstract interpretation of data-manipulation programs.
The idea of the framework could be used with other data-manipulation libraries in other languages like
Tibble in R (R also has built-in support for data frames) or DataFrames.jl in Julia.
The second result is the implementation of the Pandalyzer - Pandas analyzer based
on the Abstract Interpretation framework proposed.
The Pandalyzer is still in the early stage of development process and a lot of work is planned.
It serves as a proof of concept of the Abstract Interpretation framework for data-manipulation programs.
However, it shows that the idea is implementable and can be very useful in practice.
