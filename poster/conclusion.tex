The first result of our work is the proposition of the framework for abstract interpretation of data-manipulation programs.
The idea could be used with other data-manipulation libraries in other languages like Tibble in R\@.
The second result is the implementation of the Pandalyzer - Pandas analyzer based
on the proposed framework.
The Pandalyzer is still in the early stage of the development process, and
it serves as a proof of concept of the proposed framework.
However, it shows that the idea is implementable and can be very useful in practice.
The future works include adding support for other Pandas functions, Python language constructs, or Pandas Indexes.
The Pandalyzer could also be extended to support other well-known related Python libraries such as Numpy or Matplotlib
and integrate the Pandalyzer to the IDEs using the Language Server Protocol.
