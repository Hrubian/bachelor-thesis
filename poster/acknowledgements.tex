There are people I would not be able to finish the thesis without and I~think they deserve to~be~mentioned.
The first~person is my supervisor, Professor~Tomáš~Petříček.
I~thank~him for~his~guidance, great~insight and courage he~provided me~with.
I~would also like to~thank my~fiancée~Lana.
She~was~there for~me whenever I~needed~her, and I~am~grateful for~that.
I~would also want to~thank the~tearoom Jedna~Báseň and tearoom~ Dharmasala
for a~comfortable~spot for~writing my~thesis and a~steady~supply of~great~tea.
% TODO should it be the same as in the thesis?
