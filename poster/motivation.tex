Pandas is a Python library widely used for data manipulation. %todo
The code written with Pandas lacks any type-safety and everything is decided at runtime.
This can potentially be a source of errors and crashes at runtime.

Consider, for example, the following program:
\definecolor{mygreen}{rgb}{0,0.6,0}
\definecolor{mygray}{rgb}{0.5,0.5,0.5}
\definecolor{mymauve}{rgb}{0.58,0,0.82}

\lstset{ %
  backgroundcolor=\color{white},   % choose the background color
  basicstyle=\footnotesize,        % size of fonts used for the code
  breaklines=true,                 % automatic line breaking only at whitespace
  captionpos=b,                    % sets the caption-position to bottom
  commentstyle=\color{mygreen},    % comment style
  escapeinside={\%*}{*)},          % if you want to add LaTeX within your code
  keywordstyle=\color{blue},       % keyword style
  stringstyle=\color{mymauve},     % string literal style
}
\lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\normalsize\ttfamily, language=Python]{poster/listings/lst_motivation.py}

Our goal is to design an analysis tool capable of recognizing similar errors without forcing the user
to use another language with a stricter static type system, which is usually less user-friendly.
