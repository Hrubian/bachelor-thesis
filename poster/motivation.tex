Pandas is a Python library widely used for data manipulation. %todo
The code written with Pandas lacks any type-safety and everything is decided at runtime.
This can potentially be a source of errors and crashes at runtime.

Consider, for example, the following program:
\lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\normalsize\ttfamily]{poster/listings/lst_motivation.py}

Our goal is to design an analysis tool capable of recognizing similar errors without forcing the user
to use another language with a stricter static type system, which is usually less user-friendly.
