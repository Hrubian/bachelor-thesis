\chapter{Evaluation of solution}

This chapter is dedicated to the evaluation of the implementation presented in the previous chapter.
We design a set of realistic case studies for Pandas and evaluate the quality of analysis of the proposed solution.
We do not define any specific metrics for the evaluation since it is cumbersome to do it rigidly.
We rather look at the analysis from the more intuitive perspective and discuss which useful analysis features are
provided and which could be missing.

\section{Case Studies}

Each case study contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explanation of the case
    \item An example code in Python
    \item Description of possible mistakes
    \item
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Case Study \#1:} Hello world :) \\
Hello world

\paragraph{Case Study \#2:} Hello world :) \\
Hello world
