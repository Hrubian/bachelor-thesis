An important part of~data analysis is~called a~data~manipulation or data~wrangling.
The~goal of~the~data~manipulation is~to~take the raw~data produced by~some source and clean them and transform into
better-structured error-free data which are more suitable for the~data~analysis itself.
The data manipulations -~cleaning~and~transformations~- usually cannot be~done manually, since the~data are too large
for~that.
For manipulating large amounts of data, one needs an~automated tool.
Popular approach to solve this problem is a~library in~a~programming language.
Most of~such libraries, that became widely used in~the~industry, are Pandas~in~Python, Tibble~in~R (R also has built-in
support for~data~frames) or DataFrames.jl~in~Julia.
These libraries usually come with two types of data structures: one-dimensional array usually called Series
and two-dimensional tabular structure usually called Dataset~or~Dataframe.

The~mentioned languages, Python, R and Julia, are~all~dynamic and~interpreted languages, meaning that they do~not~provide
the~programmer with any~compile-time checks for type consistency and~variable or~column existence.
These languages are~popular in~data-related subjects due~to~their shallow learning curve, easy~syntax and~the~fact that
one does~not need to~complete course on~computer architecture to~use~it.
However, the user of~a~dynamic languages has~to~keep most of~the~information in~their~head (or~use comments~in~code a~lot)
which is~a~potential source of~many different errors, that are, in~addition, detected no~sooner than in~runtime when
the program crashes.

Potential way~to~go could~be to~use a~different programming language.
One~with static~strict~type~system, that would allow~us to~use typed data-frames~-~a data frames with statically~assigned
column~names and~types.
The results of data-frame transformations would be then determined by the function type signature.
Even though this~solution would solve the~issue with~column~naming and column~types, it~has many problems that dynamic
languages do~not have.
Actually, all~the~arguments mentioned for~the~popularity of~dynamic languages are~also~arguments against static languages.
Namely steep~learning~curve, complicated syntax, and~technical complexity.
Additionally, the~necessity for~a~lot~of~boilerplate code, worse readability and~the~fact, that~dynamic languages,
contrary~to the~static languages, usually support REPL~tool or~just creating one~file and running~it.
Ideally, we would~like to~use the~dynamic languages like~Python, R or Julia, while keeping the~safety of~static languages.

\textbf{The~goal~of~this~thesis}~is to~propose and~explore an~alternative solution to~the~problem of~data-manipulation
code being error-prone and~provide an~implementation of~such~solution.
The~solution will~be~based on~a~program verification method called Abstract Interpretation.
The origins of~the~ideas behind the~method can~be~traced back~to~1970s and~were~explored by~Patrick and~Radhia~Cousot
and~the~name Abstract Interpretation was first used on~the~Fourth ACM
Symposium on~Principles of~Programming Languages in~1977 in~Los~Angeles~\cite{Cousot:1977:AI}.
In~essence, Abstract Interpretation partially executes the~given computer program over~an~abstract domain, gaining
partial~information about the~programs semantics and~answering questions (as~mentioned
by~B.~Blanchet\cite{Blanchet:2002:AI}) such~as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item worst-case execution time
    \item security properties
    \item stack allocation
    \item unreachable code elimination
    \item and more \ldots
\end{itemize}

The~idea of~analyzing programs working with~dataframes was~already proposed once by~Yungyu~Zhuang
and~Ming-Yang~Lu\cite{Zhuang:2022:TypeChecking}.
However, we~aim to~go~deeper in~the~analysis and~choose a~different~approach for~implementing the~tool.

In~the~first chapter of~the~thesis, we~will try to~understand the~theory of~POSETs, Lattices and~Galois~connection which
are~the~core mathematical concepts of~Abstract Interpretation.
Then, in~the~second chapter, we~will explore the~needs of~data scientists regarding the~tool for~data~manipulation.
We~will~also take~a~look at~how pandas provide the data~scientists with these needs, and~we~will once~again shortly touch
the~option based~on~type systems.
The~third chapter will~put all~the~pieces together.
We~will define an~Abstract Interpretation framework for~the~world of~data-frames and~series.
We~will also take~a~look at~how some basic operations like~merge, groupby or concatenation will~work in~the~abstract domain.
The~fourth chapter will~belong to~the~implementation of~the~analysis~tool itself, its~architecture, documentation,
capabilities, and~limitations.
Finally, in~the~last, fifth, chapter, we~will evaluate the implemented solution on~a~set of~realistic examples of~pandas
code and~analyze and~discuss its~usability in~practice.
