\chapter{Abstract Interpretation}

\xxx{TODO add some more introduction (or it will probably be in the Introduction part)?}

In this chapter, we will build the theory of Abstract Interpretation from scratch, so that we are able to use the method
for the analysis in the future chapters.
We will start by defining what we mean by a Program and what can be considered an approximation of a Program.
In order to understand Abstract Interpretation, we will next dive into the theory of algebraic structure called Lattice.
Then, with all we will have done, we will be able to define Galois connection - the essence of the method itself.

\section{Program and approximation}

\subsection{Syntax}

We define a simple language: % TODO comment?

\begin{defn}[Expression]
    Expresion is defined inductively:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a constant $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is an expression
        \item a variable $x$ is an expression
        \item for each pair $E$, $F$ of expressions the following are also expressions: $E+F$, $E-F$, $E * F$, $E/F$, $E \geq F$
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Statement] % TODO or Command?
    The following are statements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item exit
        \item $x = E$ for expression $E$ %todo format
        \item if $E$ goto $n$ for expression $E$ and constant $n$
        \item input x
        \item output E for expression $E$
    \end{itemize}
    We will denote the set of all statements $\mathbb{S}$
\end{defn}

\subsection{Semantic}

\begin{defn}[Program]
    Program is a function $P: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{S}$
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Trace]
\end{defn}[Trace]

\subsection{Approximation}



\section{Lattices}

The Abstract Interpretation is defined on Lattices - algebraic structures with additional ordering constraints.
In this subchapter, we will cover

\begin{defn}[Partially ordered set]
    Partially ordered set is a tuple $(M, \leq)$, where $M$ is a (possibly infinite) set and $\leq$ is a binary relation
    which is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reflexive: $\forall x \in M, x \leq x$
        \item Antisymmetric: $\forall x, y \in M, a \leq b \land b \leq a \implies a = b$
        \item Transitive: $\forall x, y, z \in M, x \leq y \land y \leq z \implies x \leq z$
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}



\section{Galois connections, abstraction and concretization} % TODO shorter name
